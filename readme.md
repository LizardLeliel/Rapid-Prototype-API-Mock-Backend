Rapid Prototype API Mock Backend
================================

A mock backend for https://rapid-prototype-api-creator-6dhh2lnjz-lizardleliel.vercel.app/

Both of these combined demonstrate a theoritical service where
an API can be rapidly prototype used in the website's UI.

This repository represents a back end saving "schemas" and their
"fields" to permanent storage - namely to files, although
the program will be carefully created so it can be adapted
to use a database later withough significant rewrites.

It does not have any http compatibility. It is purely a demonstrative program,
its true intent mostly to practice and demonstrate my Java capabilities.
