Rapid Prototype API Mock Backend
================================

A mock backend for https://rapid-prototype-api-creator-6dhh2lnjz-lizardleliel.vercel.app/

Both of these combined demonstrate a theoritical service where
an API can be rapidly prototype used in the website's UI.

This repository represents a back end saving "schemas" and their
"fields" to permanent storage - namely to files, although
the program will be carefully created so it can be adapted
to use a database later without significant rewrites. Future plans
are to allow users to create instances of Schemas, and basic
RESTful API actions that operate on said objects, allowing people to create
and create a quick and easy RESTful API.

It does not have any http compatibility. It is purely a demonstrative program,
its true intent mostly to practice and demonstrate my Java capabilities.

Although it is intended to edit Schemas, Objects, and Actions through the frontend
website above, this program provides a text-based menu interface for the purpose of
testing and demonstration.
